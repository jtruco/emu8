    It's good to have the opportunity to make our position on this clear and I've cross-posted this to c.s.a.8 because it applies equally well to all the CPC stuff.

    However, we are happy for the CPC BASIC to be provided for use in CPC emulators provided that it is not modified from the original code and that this is done on a non-profit basis (ie any charge that is made covers purely the distribution costs).
